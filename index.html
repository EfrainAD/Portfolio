				<p class="intro">
					I am a passionate and driven full-stack software developer with a strong focus on problem-solving and continuous improvement. My dedication to enhancing my skills and seeking innovative solutions fuels my desire for novelty. The board game Go stands as a testament to my affinity for engaging challenges and my commitment to pushing the boundaries of my abilities.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					During my immersive Software Engineering course at General Assembly, I delved into a world of possibilities. With a strong focus on JavaScript, I learned the art of creating clean and understandable code. The course covered both front-end and back-end web development, allowing me to explore HTML, CSS, and dynamic frameworks such as React and Node.js. Through hands-on experience, version control with Git became second nature, enabling efficient collaboration within teams. As I delved deeper into database management, SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB ignited my curiosity. With this foundational knowledge, I am now equipped to embark on an exciting career in software development, ready to conquer any challenge that comes my way.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					These qualities are particularly significant in light of my visual and auditory impairments. Being legally blind and hard of hearing presents unique challenges, I leverage my problem-solving skills and continuous improvement mindset to develop innovative solutions that enhance accessibility. While cell phone cameras were not originally designed with accessibility in mind, they have proven to be invaluable tools for individuals like myself. Additionally, I view my VR headset as more than just a gaming device; it serves as assistive technology, providing me with a vast virtual screen that I can navigate freely. The Kindle app on my iPad also plays a crucial role in my daily life, allowing me to adjust text size to suit my specific needs. Through relentless determination, I continually push the boundaries of what I can achieve.
