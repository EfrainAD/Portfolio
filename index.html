          <h2>This is my Projects</h2>

          <h3>Project One</h3>
          <P>Outside of a tic tac toe game whit was my first project. And forst Project I struggle with. I wanted to streach myself as far as I could. This project holds the most memery for me. It was for my Geniral Assemply bootcamp, and I was very dsiapointed how far I had gotten. This is the one project I learn most about fixing stupid bugs. As time has passed, I have become less and less dsiapointed with it. I do wish I was able to do more in the timeframe I had, but I kept braking everything under the sun.</P>

               <li>spacebar: to kill zombie</li>
               <li>If you touch or to close in range you die!</li>
               <li>You need to be close enough to kill wihtout touching.</li>
               <li>You can not hill a zombie that is facing you. You can only kill from behind or from the sides.</li>

          <h2>Project 2</h2>
          <p>This is a start of a personal project I would like to work on. I plan to keep workong on this one, and use what I leanred to move that over to my 'real' project. I would like to have this stepping stone complete though.</p>
          <p>This is a study app that the user self evaluates themself, then based on there answer the flashcard will be seen again later and later, so the user can be more effient in their studies.</p>

          <h2>Project 4</h2>

          <p>This was my second project with working with a team. It very much had opened my eyes to how much fun working with a team can be. We messed up, and had some push back with each other, but we worked well with each other.</p>

          <p>We plan made an web app that had two type of users. First was a client who post a job, and the others where develapers who would pid for the job.</p>
