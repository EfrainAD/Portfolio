				<p class="intro">
					This is the part where I talk about me. Tell you that I am a full stack software engineer, even though I have not been hired for that role yet. That I enjoy solving how to do things, and always improving in what I do, or I get bored. That's probably why I like playing the board game Go so much.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					Probably good traits to have when you're legally blind and hard of hearing. As you can guess that does give you problems, and you're better off if you try to do as much as you can to limit its effects. Cell phone cameras were never made for the blind people, but they are great for us. My VR headset was made for games, I saw it as an assistive technology. Can I really have such a big screen I can move around? Yes, I can. Can I really have a my books with text as large has I need them with an ipad's kindle app? Yes, the best assistive technology for being legally blind were never intended to be. I have stubbornly tried to go up to the line of what I can do.

									<p>This a shopping oneline store app. The site fully works, but I am still changeing things to use Redux and so on as I learn them.</p>
									<p>First time learning <strong>Firebase</strong>, and how to keep things more seprate, so if firebase changes thing, you can update them only in one place.</p>
									<p>Learned more about routes, and learned about <strong>context</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, <strong>Styled-Components</strong></p>
									<p>I ended up like using handler function at top of the componets, even though it easly enough to put it in the return() directly, but it allows you to find it quicker, if you ever need to change things.</p>
									<p>Also ended up liking deconsructing my props when getting passed. Though I like both ways. ex: const {name} = props</p>

										Outside of a Tic Tac Toe game this was my first project. And the first project I struggle with. I wanted to stretch myself as far as I could. This project holds the most memories for me. It was for my General Assemply bootcamp, and I was very disapointed how far I had gotten. This is the one project I learn most about fixing bugs. As time has passed, I have become less and less disapointed with it. I do wish I was able to do more in the timeframe I had, but I kept braking everything under the sun.

               						<p>We made an web app that had two types of users. First was a client who post a job, and the others where developers who would bid for the job.</p>

									Challenges Overcomed
								</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										When displaying multiple error messages: Switching from display: none to Display block too fast made it to where the animation wouldn't work. I found nothing online to tell me why I had this problem, and had to add another setTimeout to get around it. (It displayed just fine, without the animation though.)
									</li>
									<li>
										I made a board display with gap feature, but sometimes one gab was larger then the othere, so I had to let this idea go, and change the boarders with a function to customize it by where it was in the "line up".
									</li>
									<li>
										Because the AI had to track the "successful" move, then see if it quilityfied as a win, and it had to wait to process everything first to know, and keep the best one, this got a little trickly, and messey to keep track of. Was a good experince to try and work this out.
