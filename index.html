				<p class="intro">
					I am a passionate and driven full-stack software developer with a strong focus on problem-solving and continuous improvement. My dedication to enhancing my skills and seeking innovative solutions fuels my desire for novelty. The board game Go stands as a testament to my affinity for engaging challenges and my commitment to pushing the boundaries of my abilities.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					I completed an immersive Software Engineering course at General Assembly, which equipped me with a comprehensive skill set essential for success in the field. Throughout the program, I focused on JavaScript as the primary programming language, emphasizing clean and understandable code. The course covered front-end and back-end web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React and Node.js. I gained hands-on experience with version control systems, particularly Git, and learned Agile development methodologies for effective teamwork. Database management was another key aspect, encompassing SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB. With this foundation, I was given a prepared starting point to tackle software engineering challenges and contribute to the world of software development.
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					These qualities are particularly significant in light of my visual and auditory impairments. Being legally blind and hard of hearing presents unique challenges, I leverage my problem-solving skills and continuous improvement mindset to develop innovative solutions that enhance accessibility. While cell phone cameras were not originally designed with accessibility in mind, they have proven to be invaluable tools for individuals like myself. Additionally, I view my VR headset as more than just a gaming device; it serves as assistive technology, providing me with a vast virtual screen that I can navigate freely. The Kindle app on my iPad also plays a crucial role in my daily life, allowing me to adjust text size to suit my specific needs. Through relentless determination, I continually push the boundaries of what I can achieve.

									<p>This is a shopping online store app. The site fully works, but I am still changing things to use Redux and so on as I learn them.</p>
									<p>It's my first time learning <strong>Firebase</strong> and how to keep things more separate so if Firebase changes things, you can update them in only one place.</p>
									<p>I've learned more about routes and about <strong>context</strong>, <strong>SASS</strong>, and <strong>Styled-Components</strong>.</p>
									<p>I ended up liking using handler functions at the top of the components, even though it's easy enough to put them in the return() directly. However, it allows you to find them quicker if you ever need to change things.</p>
									<p>I also ended up liking destructuring my props when they are passed, although I like both ways. For example: const {name} = props.</p>

										Outside of a Tic Tac Toe game, this was my first project and the first project I struggled with. I wanted to stretch myself as far as I could. This project holds the most memories for me. It was for my General Assembly bootcamp, and I was very disappointed with how far I had gotten. This is the one project from which I learned the most about fixing bugs. As time has passed, I have become less and less disappointed with it. I do wish I was able to do more in the timeframe I had, but I kept breaking everything under the sun.

										This was my second project working with a team. It really opened my eyes to how much fun working with a team can be. We made mistakes and had some pushback with each other, but ultimately we worked well together.

									Tic Tac Toe game was my first major homework assignment in General Assembly. I revisited it and completed both the assigned bonuses and added my own personal bonuses on top of that.

									One of my main goals was also to utilize the principles of presets to make my code cleaner.

									Challenges Overcomed
								</div>
								<ol>
									<li>
										When displaying multiple error messages: switching from display: none to display block too fast made it so that the animation wouldn't work. I found no online resources to explain why I had this problem, and had to add another setTimeout to work around it (it displayed fine without the animation though).
									 </li>
									 <li>
										I tried making a board display with a gap feature, but sometimes one gap was larger than the others. I had to abandon this idea and instead change the borders with a function to customize them based on their position in the lineup.
									 </li>
									 <li>
										The AI had to track the "successful" move, then determine if it qualified as a win. It had to wait to process everything first to know and keep the best move, which made it a little tricky and messy to keep track of. It was a good learning experience to try and work through this.

								<div>
									<div class="p-header has-text-centered">
										The main things I learned:
									</div>
									<ul>
										<li>I gained a better understanding of middleware.</li>
										<li>I learned how to build authentication with JSON Web Tokens and used cookies. I didn’t use JSON Web Tokens or cookies in my past projects.</li>
										<li>I learned how to set up emails and send them to users’ email addresses so that they can reset their password if they forgot it.</li>
										<li>I also learned that when setting up the “contact us” feature, I can set the email to go to the owner of the website, so that when they click reply, it will use the user’s email address.</li>
										<li>I learned how to upload images with Multer and save them to Cloudinary.</li>
										<li>I learned how to manage state with Redux Toolkit, although I prefer the implementation I am learning in another tutorial better.</li>
										<li>I utilized the "express-async-handler" package.</li>
										<li>I set up error handling in Express.</li>
									</ul>
									<div class="p-header has-text-centered">
										Main things I learned on my own
									</div>
									<ol>
										<li>I changed the upload image with Multer to use memory/buffer instead of saving the file on the server. A free server didn't want me to use up their space, and it was wasteful anyway since I was just uploading it to Cloudinary.</li>
										<li>I also set it up so that you could easily change Multer methods with env.</li>
										<li>I didn’t like uploading images to Cloudinary from the frontend by setting it up to not require a signature, as the tutorial showed me. So I looked at the Cloudinary documentation to see how I could use signatures that would be sent from my API to the client to upload the image from there.</li>
										<li>Another reason I didn't like how the tutorial did this was that anyone could flood my Cloudinary storage by uploading files again and again. So I found that I could give the file a name, and if I tried to upload a file with the same name, it would overwrite the old file. I liked this because it kept my storage clean. And the signature made sure they couldn't name the file anything they wanted. I used the user ID for profile pictures because they are unique and the SKU for the product for the same reason.</li>
										<li>I also added the image to be deleted when a product was deleted. The documentation said nothing about needing to put the holder name as part of the public_ID. I was confused as to why, but I at least figured it out by guessing.</li>
										<li>I didn’t like that users could get to the login page when they were already logged in, so I made it redirect them away from that page if they were logged in.</li>
										<li>Because the implementation of pagination had changed since the tutorial was made, I practiced understanding the documentation for it so that I could implement it as if it were completely new to me. The way they were showing me how to use it was not the way I would have written it.</li>
										<li>Having the Chrome DevTools open can cause a crash.</li>
									</ol>
									<p>Building an inventory app, I learned the most about authorizing users using <strong>JWT authentication</strong>, using tokens with cookies, how middleware works (versus using them without knowing why it worked), uploading files, and setting up emails.</p>
									<p>I learned some frontend things, but those were shown to me without being explained.</p>
