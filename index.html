          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>This is the part where I talk about me. Tell you that I am a full stack software engineer, even though I have not been hired for that role yet. That I enjoy solving how to do things, and always improving in what I do, or I get bored. That's probably why I like playing the board game Go so much.</p>
          <p>Probably good traits to have when you're legally blind and hard of hearing. As you can guess that does give you problems, and you're better off if you try to do as much as you can to limit its effects. Cell phone cameras were never made for the blind people, but they are great for us. My VR headset was made for games, I saw it as an assistive technology. Can I really have such a big screen I can move around? Yes, I can. Can I really have a my books with text as large has I need them with an ipad's kindle app? Yes, the best assistive technology for being legally blind were never intended to be. I have stubbornly tried to go up to the line of what I can do.</p>

          <h2>This is my Projects</h2>
          <h3>Project 1</h3>
          <P>Outside of a tic tac toe game whit was my first project. And first Project I struggle with. I wanted to streach myself as far as I could. This project holds the most memery for me. It was for my Geniral Assemply bootcamp, and I was very dsiapointed how far I had gotten. This is the one project I learn most about fixing stupid bugs. As time has passed, I have become less and less dsiapointed with it. I do wish I was able to do more in the timeframe I had, but I kept braking everything under the sun.</P>
          <ul>
               <li>User arrow keys to move around. (You can use asde key if you like.)</li>
               <li>spacebar: to kill zombie</li>
               <li>If you touch or to close in range you die!</li>
               <li>You need to be close enough to kill wihtout touching.</li>
               <li>You can not hill a zombie that is facing you. You can only kill from behind or from the sides.</li>
               <li>May need to refrest the page when you first load it.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Project 2</h2>
          <p>This is a start of a personal project I would like to work on. I plan to keep workong on this one, and use what I leanred to move that over to my 'real' project. I would like to have this stepping stone complete though.</p>
          <p>This is a study app that the user self evaluates themself, then based on there answer the flashcard will be seen again later and later, so the user can be more effient in their studies.</p>

          <h2>Project 4</h2>

          <p>This was my second project with working with a team. It very much had opened my eyes to how much fun working with a team can be. We messed up, and had some push back with each other, but we worked well with each other.</p>

          <p>We plan made an web app that had two type of users. First was a client who post a job, and the others where develapers who would pid for the job.</p>
