      <p>This app is a workout app designed to be simple and easy to use. I personally didn't like the current apps, so I decided to create one that I would enjoy using.</p>
      
      <h3>Collaborators</h3>
      <p>A UX graduate joined me to create the design and add features to this project. From there, I created an ERD and a component diagram, as well as determining the Firebase structure that makes sense. I am currently working on this with another software engineer.</p>
      
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>To learn programming collaboratively with others, including UX designers and other developers.</li>
         <li>To learn React Native and become more familiar with SQL, as most of my work is in NoSQL.</li>
         <li>To become familiar with Jira and Figma.</li>
         <li>To develop leadership skills by leading a group.</li>
         <li>Have something in the app store.</li>

      <p>This site is designed to record jobs you apply to and allows a coach to keep an eye on many coaches. The first version is just the job tracker without the coach. I keep adding features to version one.</p>
      
      <h3>Where am I?</h3>
      <p>I am working in both the frontend and backend. I had built the API first, but every time I add a new feature that I want when using it, it requires that I go in and add that to the API as well.</p>
      
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>To apply what I have learned from General Assembly, tutorials, and my volunteer work to something I have designed myself.</li>
         <li>I hope to get a General Assembly coach to use it because it is a good product.</li>
