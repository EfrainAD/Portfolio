      <p>This app is a workout app designed to be simple and easy to use. I personally didn't like the current apps, so I decided to create one that I would enjoy using.</p>
      
      <h3>Collaborators</h3>
      <p>A UX graduate joined me to create the design and add features to this project. From there, I created an ERD and a component diagram, as well as determining the Firebase structure that makes sense. I am currently working on this with another software engineer.</p>
      
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>To learn programming collaboratively with others, including UX designers and other developers.</li>
         <li>To learn React Native and become more familiar with SQL, as most of my work is in NoSQL.</li>
         <li>To become familiar with Jira and Figma.</li>
         <li>To develop leadership skills by leading a group.</li>
         <li>Have something in the app store.</li>

      <p>This site is designed to record jobs you apply to and allows a coach to keep an eye on many coaches. The first version is just the job tracker without the coach. I keep adding features to version one.</p>
      
      <h3>Where am I?</h3>
      <p>I am working in both the frontend and backend. I had built the API first, but every time I add a new feature that I want when using it, it requires that I go in and add that to the API as well.</p>
      
      <h3>Goals:</h3>
      <ul>
         <li>To apply what I have learned from General Assembly, tutorials, and my volunteer work to something I have designed myself.</li>

         Play Tic-Tac-Toe against an AI bot I built. It strategically plays to either create a winning position for itself or prevent you from making a move that would grant you two ways to win the game. You can change board size, the x and o, to animal heads.

            When displaying multiple error messages: switching from display: none to display block too fast made it so that the animation wouldn't work.

            I tried making a board display with a gap feature, but sometimes one gap was larger than the others. I had to abandon this idea and instead change the borders with a function to customize them based on their position in the lineup.

            The AI had to track the "successful" move, then determine if it qualified as a win. It had to wait to process everything first to know and keep the best move, which made it a little tricky and messy to keep track of.

         Building this inventory app, I learned the most about authorizing users using <strong>JWT authentication</strong>, employing tokens with cookies, uploading files to the server and services like Cloudinary, and setting up emails. This enables users to reset their password or provide feedback, allowing the owner to reply to the email as if it came directly from them. I also began using <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong>.

         Main things I learned on my own
      </div>
      <ol>
         <li>I changed the image upload method with Multer to use memory/buffer instead of saving the file on the server. A free server didn't want me to use up their space, and it was wasteful anyway since I was just uploading it to Cloudinary.</li>
         <li>I also set it up so that you could easily change Multer methods with env.</li>
         <li>I didn’t like uploading images to Cloudinary from the frontend without requiring a signature, as the tutorial showed me. So I looked at the Cloudinary documentation to see how I could use signatures sent from my API to the client to upload the image from there.</li>
         <li>Another reason I didn't like how the tutorial did this was that anyone could flood my Cloudinary storage by uploading files repeatedly. So I found that I could give the file a name, and if I tried to upload a file with the same name, it would overwrite the old file. I liked this because it kept my storage clean. And the signature made sure they couldn't name the file anything they wanted. I used the user ID for profile pictures because they are unique and the SKU for the product for the same reason.</li>
         <li>I also added the image to be deleted when a product was deleted. The documentation said nothing about needing to put the holder name as part of the public_ID. I was able to figure it out.</li>
         <li>I didn’t like that users could get to the login page when they were already logged in, so I made it redirect them away from that page if they were logged in.</li>
         <li>Having the Chrome DevTools open can cause a crash. Check if your app crashes in a different browser. It might be an extension you have.</li>
