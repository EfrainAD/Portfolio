         Outside of a Tic Tac Toe game, this was my first project and the first project I struggled with. I wanted to stretch myself as far as I could. This project holds the most memories for me. It was for my General Assembly bootcamp, and I was very disappointed with how far I had gotten. This is the one project from which I learned the most about fixing bugs. As time has passed, I have become less and less disappointed with it. I do wish I was able to do more in the timeframe I had, but I kept breaking everything under the sun.
